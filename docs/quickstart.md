## First Steps

### 1. Your First AGI Model

```python
import agi_formula as agi

# Create a simple conscious AGI model
class MyFirstAGI(agi.core.Component):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.transform = agi.core.Transform(10, 5)
        self.activation = agi.core.Activation()
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.transform(x)
        return self.activation(x)

# Initialize with consciousness
model = MyFirstAGI()
print(f"Initial consciousness: {model._consciousness_level:.3f}")

# Create sample input
x = agi.tensor([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])
output = model(x)

print(f"Output shape: {output.data.shape}")
print(f"Consciousness after computation: {model._consciousness_level:.3f}")
```

### 2. Training with Consciousness Evolution

```python
# Set up training
optimizer = agi.optim.Adam(model.variables(), lr=0.001)
loss_fn = agi.core.MSELoss()

# Sample data
X = agi.tensor([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])
y = agi.tensor([[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]])

print("Training with consciousness evolution:")
print("Epoch | Loss    | Consciousness")
print("------|---------|-------------")

# Training loop
for epoch in range(10):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    
    # Forward pass
    prediction = model(X)
    loss = loss_fn(prediction, y)
    
    # Backward pass
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    
    # Track progress
    if epoch % 2 == 0:
        print(f"{epoch:5d} | {loss.item():7.4f} | {model._consciousness_level:11.3f}")

print(f"\nFinal consciousness: {model._consciousness_level:.3f}")
```

### 3. Multi-Modal Reasoning

```python
# Create reasoning engine
reasoning_engine = agi.ReasoningEngine()

print("Demonstrating multi-modal reasoning:")

# Logical reasoning
print("\n1. Logical Reasoning:")
reasoning_engine.logical_reasoner.add_fact("sunny_weather")
reasoning_engine.logical_reasoner.add_rule("sunny_weather", "go_outside", confidence=0.9)

inferences = reasoning_engine.logical_reasoner.infer("activity_decision")
print(f"   Generated {len(inferences)} logical inferences")

# Causal reasoning  
print("\n2. Causal Reasoning:")
observations = [
    {"variables": {"temperature": 30, "ice_cream_sales": 120}},
    {"variables": {"temperature": 25, "ice_cream_sales": 100}},
    {"variables": {"temperature": 20, "ice_cream_sales": 80}}
]

causes = reasoning_engine.causal_reasoner.discover_causes("ice_cream_sales", observations)
print(f"   Discovered {len(causes)} causal relationships")

# Temporal reasoning
print("\n3. Temporal Reasoning:")
sequence = ["wake_up", "breakfast", "work", "lunch", "work", "dinner", "sleep"]
reasoning_engine.temporal_reasoner.add_temporal_sequence(sequence)

test_sequence = ["wake_up", "breakfast", "work"]
predictions = reasoning_engine.temporal_reasoner.predict_next(test_sequence)
print(f"   Next event predictions: {dict(predictions)}")
```

### 4. Conscious Intelligence

```python
# Create intelligent agent
intelligence = agi.Intelligence(consciousness_level=0.8)

print("\nDemonstrating conscious intelligence:")

# Pattern recognition
print("\n1. Pattern Recognition:")
pattern = agi.tensor([[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]])
perceived, concepts = intelligence.perceive(pattern)
print(f"   Extracted {len(concepts)} concepts from cross pattern")

# Problem solving
print("\n2. Problem Solving:")
problem_context = {
    "problem_type": "optimization",
    "goal": "minimize_energy_usage",
    "constraints": ["maintain_comfort", "reduce_costs"]
}

solution = intelligence.think("How to optimize building energy usage?", problem_context)
if solution:
    print(f"   Solution approach: {solution['method']}")
    print(f"   Confidence: {solution['confidence']:.3f}")

# Creative generation
print("\n3. Creative Generation:")
creative_goal = "Design an innovative transportation system"
constraints = {"eco_friendly": True, "cost_effective": True, "scalable": True}

creative_solutions = intelligence.create(creative_goal, constraints)
print(f"   Generated {len(creative_solutions)} creative solutions")

for i, solution in enumerate(creative_solutions[:2]):
    print(f"   Solution {i+1}: creativity={solution['creativity_score']:.2f}")
```

## Key Concepts

### Consciousness Integration

Every AGI-Formula component includes consciousness as a fundamental aspect:

```python
# All components have consciousness levels
component = agi.core.Transform(10, 5)
print(f"Component consciousness: {component._consciousness_level}")

# Consciousness evolves during computation
for _ in range(5):
    output = component(agi.tensor([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]]))
    print(f"Consciousness: {component._consciousness_level:.3f}")
```

### Multi-Modal Reasoning

AGI-Formula integrates four reasoning types:

1. **Logical**: Rule-based inference with facts and rules
2. **Causal**: Cause-effect relationship discovery
3. **Temporal**: Sequential pattern recognition and prediction
4. **Abstract**: Analogical reasoning and concept generalization

### Creative Intelligence

AGI-Formula generates novel solutions through:

```python
intelligence = agi.Intelligence()

# Creative problem solving
solutions = intelligence.create(
    goal="Solve traffic congestion",
    constraints={"budget_limited": True, "environmentally_friendly": True}
)

print(f"Generated {len(solutions)} creative solutions")
```

### Meta-Learning

AGI-Formula learns how to learn better:

```python
agent = agi.ConsciousAgent()

# Learning from experience
experiences = [
    {"strategy": "pattern_matching", "success": 0.7},
    {"strategy": "rule_induction", "success": 0.9},
    {"strategy": "creative_generation", "success": 0.8}
]

for exp in experiences:
    agent.meta_learn(exp)  # Adapts learning strategy
```

## Common Patterns

### Basic Training Loop

```python
model = YourAGIModel()
optimizer = agi.optim.Adam(model.variables())
loss_fn = agi.core.MSELoss()

for epoch in range(epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(input_data)
    loss = loss_fn(output, target_data)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    
    # Monitor consciousness evolution
    if epoch % 10 == 0:
        print(f"Consciousness: {model._consciousness_level:.3f}")
```

### Reasoning Pipeline

```python
reasoning_engine = agi.ReasoningEngine()

# Add knowledge
reasoning_engine.logical_reasoner.add_fact("known_fact")
reasoning_engine.logical_reasoner.add_rule("premise", "conclusion", 0.8)

# Perform reasoning
context = {"domain": "problem_domain", "data": problem_data}
results = reasoning_engine.reason(query, context)
```

### Creative Problem Solving

```python
intelligence = agi.Intelligence(consciousness_level=0.8)

# Define problem and constraints
problem = "Your problem description"
constraints = {"constraint1": True, "constraint2": False}

# Generate solutions
solutions = intelligence.create(problem, constraints)

# Evaluate solutions
for solution in solutions:
    print(f"Creativity: {solution['creativity_score']:.2f}")
    print(f"Feasibility: {solution['feasibility']:.2f}")
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import errors:**
```bash
# Ensure proper installation
pip install -e .

# Verify installation
python -c "import agi_formula; print('Success!')"
```

**Performance slower than expected:**
- Check Python version (3.8+ recommended)
- Ensure NumPy 1.21+ is installed
- Run multiple times for stable averages
- Check system resources and background processes

**PyTorch comparison not working:**
```bash
# Install PyTorch for comparisons
pip install torch>=1.9.0
```

**Consciousness not evolving:**
- Ensure you're calling forward() on components
- Check that experiences have sufficient complexity
- Verify learning experiences are being processed
