## Example Categories

### 1. Basic Usage Examples

**Simple Model Creation:**
```python
import agi_formula as agi

# Create conscious AGI model
class SimpleAGI(agi.core.Component):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.transform = agi.core.Transform(10, 5)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.transform(x)

model = SimpleAGI()
print(f"Consciousness: {model._consciousness_level}")
```

**Training with Consciousness Evolution:**
```python
optimizer = agi.optim.Adam(model.variables(), lr=0.001)
loss_fn = agi.core.MSELoss()

for epoch in range(10):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(agi.tensor([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]]))
    loss = loss_fn(output, agi.tensor([[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]))
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    
    print(f"Epoch {epoch}: Consciousness={model._consciousness_level:.3f}")
```

### 2. Reasoning Examples

**Multi-Modal Reasoning:**
```python
# Create reasoning engine
reasoning_engine = agi.ReasoningEngine()

# Logical reasoning
reasoning_engine.logical_reasoner.add_fact("sunny_day")
reasoning_engine.logical_reasoner.add_rule("sunny_day", "go_outside", 0.9)
inferences = reasoning_engine.logical_reasoner.infer("activity_suggestion")

# Causal reasoning
observations = [{"variables": {"temp": 25, "sales": 100}}]
causes = reasoning_engine.causal_reasoner.discover_causes("sales", observations)

# Temporal reasoning
sequence = ["morning", "work", "lunch", "work"]
predictions = reasoning_engine.temporal_reasoner.predict_next(sequence)
```

**Creative Problem Solving:**
```python
intelligence = agi.Intelligence(consciousness_level=0.8)

# Generate creative solutions
creative_solutions = intelligence.create(
    "Design optimal delivery route",
    constraints={"minimize_cost": True, "maximize_efficiency": True}
)
```

### 3. ARC-AGI Examples

**Pattern Recognition:**
```python
# Analyze ARC-AGI grid pattern
pattern = agi.tensor([[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]])
perceived, concepts = intelligence.perceive(pattern)
print(f"Extracted {len(concepts)} concepts")
```

**Rule Induction:**
```python
# Learn transformation rule from examples
examples = [
    {"input": [[1, 0]], "output": [[0, 1]]},
    {"input": [[1, 1, 0]], "output": [[0, 1, 1]]}
]

for example in examples:
    context = {
        "input": example["input"],
        "output": example["output"],
        "transformation_type": "spatial"
    }
    rule = intelligence.think("What rule transforms input to output?", context)
    print(f"Rule: {rule['method']}, Confidence: {rule['confidence']:.3f}")
```

**Pattern Completion:**
```python
# Complete incomplete pattern
incomplete = [[1, None, 1], [None, 1, None], [1, None, 1]]
context = {
    "partial_grid": incomplete,
    "pattern_type": "symmetric"
}

completion = intelligence.think("Complete this symmetric pattern", context)
creative_solutions = intelligence.create(
    "Complete pattern maintaining symmetry",
    constraints={"maintain_symmetry": True}
)
```

### 4. Consciousness Examples

**Consciousness Evolution:**
```python
agent = agi.ConsciousAgent(consciousness_level=0.4)

# Simulate learning experiences
experiences = [
    {"complexity": 0.3, "success": True},
    {"complexity": 0.7, "success": True}, 
    {"complexity": 1.0, "success": False},
    {"complexity": 1.2, "success": True}
]

for exp in experiences:
    agent.learn(exp)
    print(f"Consciousness: {agent.consciousness.awareness_level:.3f}")
```

**Meta-Learning:**
```python
# Meta-learning improves learning itself
learning_outcomes = [
    {"strategy": "pattern_matching", "success": 0.7},
    {"strategy": "rule_induction", "success": 0.9},
    {"strategy": "creative_synthesis", "success": 0.6}
]

for outcome in learning_outcomes:
    agent.meta_learn(outcome)
    # Agent adapts learning strategy based on outcomes
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import errors:**
```python
# Make sure AGI-Formula is installed
pip install -e .

# Check installation
import agi_formula as agi
print(agi.__version__)  # Should show version 1.0.0
```

**Missing PyTorch for comparisons:**
```bash
# Install PyTorch for benchmark comparisons
pip install torch>=1.9.0
```

**Performance differs from expected:**
- Results may vary slightly based on random initialization
- Run multiple times and average for stable results
- Check that consciousness evolution is occurring (should see increasing values)

**Examples fail to run:**
- Ensure you're running from the correct directory
- Check that all required files are present in `agi_formula/` directory
- Verify that core modules (`consciousness.py`, `reasoning.py`, `intelligence.py`, `core.py`) exist

### Getting Help

1. **Check the documentation:** See `docs/` directory for detailed API reference
2. **Review test results:** Run `temp_testing/` benchmarks to verify installation
3. **Examine performance reports:** Check `temp_testing/PERFORMANCE_REPORT.md` for detailed analysis

## Next Steps

After running these examples:

1. **Explore the API:** See `docs/api.md` for comprehensive API documentation
