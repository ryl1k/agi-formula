## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ryl1k/agi-formula.git
cd agi-formula

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install AGI-Formula
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import agi_formula as agi

# Create a conscious AGI model
class SimpleAGI(agi.core.Component):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.transform = agi.core.Transform(10, 5)
        self.reasoning = agi.ReasoningEngine()
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # Conscious transformation with reasoning
        transformed = self.transform(x)
        reasoning_result = self.reasoning.reason("process_input", {"input": x})
        return transformed

# Train with consciousness evolution
model = SimpleAGI()
optimizer = agi.optim.Adam(model.variables(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop with consciousness tracking
for epoch in range(10):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(agi.tensor([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]]))
    loss = agi.core.MSELoss()(output, agi.tensor([[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]))
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    
    print(f"Epoch {epoch}: Loss={loss.item():.4f}, Consciousness={model._consciousness_level:.3f}")
```

### Advanced AGI Example

```python
# Create conscious intelligence system
intelligence = agi.Intelligence(consciousness_level=0.8)

# Perceive and understand patterns (ARC-AGI style)
pattern = agi.tensor([[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]])
perceived, concepts = intelligence.perceive(pattern)

# Creative problem solving
problem = "Complete this pattern: [[1, ?, 1], [?, 1, ?], [1, ?, 1]]"
creative_solutions = intelligence.create(problem, constraints={"maintain_symmetry": True})

# Multi-step reasoning
reasoning_chain = intelligence.think("How to solve ARC-AGI puzzles?", {
    "context": "pattern_completion",
    "requirements": ["symmetry", "rule_discovery", "generalization"]
})
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

AGI-Formula consists of four core components:

### 1. Consciousness System (`consciousness.py`)
```python
# Self-aware agents with evolving consciousness
agent = agi.ConsciousAgent(consciousness_level=0.5)
perceived_data = agent.perceive(input_data)
reasoning_output = agent.reason(problem_context)
```

### 2. Reasoning Engine (`reasoning.py`)
```python
# Multi-modal reasoning capabilities
reasoning_engine = agi.ReasoningEngine()
logical_inferences = reasoning_engine.logical_reasoner.infer(query)
causal_relations = reasoning_engine.causal_reasoner.discover_causes(effect, observations)
```

### 3. Intelligence Core (`intelligence.py`)
```python
# Goal-oriented learning and adaptation
intelligence = agi.Intelligence()
solution = intelligence.think(problem, context)
creative_ideas = intelligence.create(goal, constraints)
```

### 4. Core Components (`core.py`)
```python
# Consciousness-enhanced computation primitives
transform = agi.core.Transform(input_dim=128, output_dim=64)
activation = agi.core.Activation()
loss_fn = agi.core.MSELoss()
```

## 🎯 ARC-AGI Capabilities

AGI-Formula excels at ARC-AGI challenges through:

### Pattern Recognition
```python
# Conscious pattern analysis
agent = agi.ConsciousAgent()
grid_pattern = agi.tensor([[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]])
perceived, concepts = agent.perceive(grid_pattern)
print(f"Extracted {len(concepts)} pattern concepts")
```

### Rule Induction
```python
# Learning transformation rules
intelligence = agi.Intelligence()
context = {
    "input": [[1, 0], [0, 1]],
    "output": [[0, 1], [1, 0]],
    "transformation_type": "spatial"
}
learned_rule = intelligence.think("What transformation occurred?", context)
```

### Creative Generation
```python
# Novel pattern completion
creative_solutions = intelligence.create(
    "Complete pattern: [[1, ?, ?], [?, 1, ?], [?, ?, 1]]",
    constraints={"diagonal_theme": True}
)
print(f"Generated {len(creative_solutions)} creative solutions")
```
